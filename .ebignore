# .ebignore
#
# You can tell the EB CLI to ignore certain files in your project
# directory with a .ebignore file. This file works like a .gitignore.
# When you deploy your project directory to Elastic Beanstalk and create
# a new application version, the EB CLI will not include files specified
# by the .ebignore in the source bundle that it creates. This is useful
# for creating smaller packages by excluding files that aren't required
# for running production-only code.

# MOST IMPORTANTLY, THIS FILE DOES **NOT** IGNORE DIST, its required
# for deployment.

# Ignore application dependencies
# We don't want deps. built for OS X/Windows winding up on a linux
# instance, etc. Let the container provision its own dependencies.
