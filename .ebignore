# .ebignore
#
# You can tell the EB CLI to ignore certain files in your project
# directory with a .ebignore file. This file works like a .gitignore.
# When you deploy your project directory to Elastic Beanstalk and create
# a new application version, the EB CLI will not include files specified
# by the .ebignore in the source bundle that it creates. This is useful
# for creating smaller packages by excluding files that aren't required
# for running production-only code.

# Ignore everything!
*

# Except for these exclusion patterns required by Amazon ECS
